# FizzBuzz-Network using PyTorch
Have you ever played the game FizzBuzz.? 
This game has been used as a fun example by Joel Grus (http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) ( Research Engineer at AI2 ) , which teaches children about Division. 

### Problem Framing:

We formulate the problem as simple classification task where the problem classifies the output to different categories :
* fizz  
* 'buzz' 
* 'FizzBuzz' 
* 'No Change'

We also converted the input number to binary-encoded form, which is easier for the network to process than whole numbers.

* IMAGE


Although this particular example doesn't solve any practical problem but it's a fun way to see how a Neural Net works. As I've been learning PyTorch, I decided to give it's implementation a try.
